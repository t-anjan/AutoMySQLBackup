AutoMySQLBackup
===================
AutoMySQLBackup with a basic configuration will create Daily, Weekly and Monthly backups of one or more of your MySQL databases from one or more of your MySQL servers.

Other Features include:
 - Email notification of backups
 - Backup Compression and Encryption
 - Configurable backup rotation
 - Incremental database backups

Project originally hosted on **[Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/)**.

### DISCLAIMER 

I take no resposibility for any data loss or corruption when using this script.
This script will not help in the event of a hard drive crash. If a copy of the
backup has not been stored offline or on another PC. You should copy your backups
offline regularly for best protection.

Happy backing up..


### USAGE


Automysqlbackup can be run a number of ways, you can choose which is best for you.

1. Create a script as below called runmysqlbackup using the lines below:

```
#!/bin/sh**

/usr/local/bin/automysqlbackup /etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf

chown root.root /var/backup/db* -R
find /var/backup/db* -type f -exec chmod 400 {} \;
find /var/backup/db* -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \;
```

2. Save it to a suitable location or copy it to your /etc/cron.daily folder. 

3. Make it executable, i.e. `chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/runmysqlbackup`.



The backup can be run from the command line simply by running the following command.

  `automysqlbackup /etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf`

If you don't supply an argument for automysqlbackup, the default configuration
in the program automysqlbackup will be used unless a global file

  CONFIG_configfile="/etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf"

exists.

You can just copy the supplied automysqlbackup.conf as many times as you want
and use for separate configurations, i.e. for example different mysql servers.


### !!! NEW !!!
As of version 3.0 we have added differential backups using the program diff. In an
effort to make the reconstruction of the full archives more user friendly, we
added new functionality to the script. Therefore, while preserving the old syntax,
we created options for the script, so that the new functions can be accessed.

```
Usage automysqlbackup options -cblh
-c CONFIG_FILE  Specify optional config file.
-b      Use backup method.
-l      List manifest entries.
-h      Show this help.
```
If you use these options, you have to specify everything according to them and can't
mix the old syntax with the new one. Example:

before (still valid!):

 ` >> automysqlbackup "myconfig.conf"`

now:

 `` >> automysqlbackup -c "myconfig.conf" -b`

which is equivalent to

  `>> automysqlbackup -bc "myconfig.conf"`

or in English: The order of the options doesn't matter, however those options expecting
arguments, have to be placed right before the argument (as seen above).

The option '-l' (List manifest entries) finds all Manifest files in your configuration
directory (you need to specify your optional config file - otherwise a fallback will be
used: global config file -> program internal default options). It then filters from which
databases these are and presents you with a list (you can select more than one!) of them.
Once you have chosen, you will be given a list of Manifest files, from which you choose
again and after that from which you choose differential files. When you have completed
all your selections, a list of selected differential files will be shown. You may then
choose what you want to be done with/to those files. At the moment the options are:
- create full backup out of differential one
- remove the differential backup and its Manifest entry.


### CONFIGURATION OPTIONS


!! "automysqlbackup" program contains a default configuration that should not be changed:

The global config file which overwrites the default configuration is located here
`/etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf` by default.

Please take a look at the supplied "automysqlbackup.conf" for information about the configuration options.
```
Default configuration
CONFIG_configfile="/etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf"
CONFIG_backup_dir='/var/backup/db'
CONFIG_do_monthly="01"
CONFIG_do_weekly="5"
CONFIG_rotation_daily=6
CONFIG_rotation_weekly=35
CONFIG_rotation_monthly=150
CONFIG_mysql_dump_usessl='yes'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_username='root'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_password=''
CONFIG_mysql_dump_host='localhost'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_socket=''
CONFIG_mysql_dump_create_database='no'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_use_separate_dirs='yes'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_compression='gzip'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_commcomp='no'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_latest='no'
CONFIG_mysql_dump_max_allowed_packet=''
CONFIG_db_names=()
CONFIG_db_month_names=()
CONFIG_db_exclude=( 'information_schema' )
CONFIG_mailcontent='log'
CONFIG_mail_maxattsize=4000
CONFIG_mail_address='root'
CONFIG_encrypt='no'
CONFIG_encrypt_password='password0123'
```
automysqlbackup (the shell program) accepts one parameter, the filename of a configuration file. The entries in there will supersede all others.

Please take a look at the supplied "automysqlbackup.conf" for information about the configuration options.

### ENCRYPTION

To decrypt run (replace bz2 with gz if using gzip):

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted_file_name(ex: *.enc.bz2) -out outputfilename.bz2 -pass pass:PASSWORD-USED-TO-ENCRYPT


### BACKUP ROTATION

Daily Backups are rotated weekly.
Weekly Backups are run on fridays, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_do_weekly.
Weekly Backups are rotated on a 5 week cycle, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_rotation_weekly.
Monthly Backups are run on the 1st of the month, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_do_monthly.
Monthly Backups are rotated on a 5 month cycle, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_rotation_monthly.

Suggestion: It may be a good idea to copy monthly backups offline or to another server.

### RESTORING

Firstly you will need to uncompress the backup file and decrypt it if encryption was used (see encryption section).

eg.
`gunzip file.gz (or bunzip2 file.bz2)`

Next you will need to use the mysql client to restore the DB from the sql file.

eg.
  `mysql --user=username --pass=password --host=dbserver database < /path/file.sql`
or
  `mysql --user=username --pass=password --host=dbserver -e "source /path/file.sql" database`

NOTE: Make sure you use "<" and not ">" in the above command because you are piping the file.sql to mysql and not the other way around.


What is special about this fork?
-------------

AutoMySQLBackup uses the **[mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html)** tool that comes as part of MySQL to generate the backups. 

Historically, the script passed the MySQL username and password utilized for making the backups to mysqldump via command-line. As of MySQL 5.6, passing credentials via command-line is **considered insecure** and attempts to do so generates warning messages that disrupt normal processing of the AutoMySQLBackup script and sometimes breaks the script altogether, causing backups to fail.

**Example:**
```bash
    [root@server ~]# automysqlbackup
    Invoking backup method.
    Parsed config file "/etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf"
    ...
    ....
    ###### WARNING ######
    Errors reported during AutoMySQLBackup execution.. Backup failed
    Error log below..
    mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
    mysqldump: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
    mysqldump: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
```
Several fixes have been mentioned [here](https://github.com/rcruz/AutoMySQLBackup/issues/1) and [here](http://www.redeo.nl/2013/11/automysqlbackup-warning-using-password-command-line-interface-can-insecure/). 

I tried assimilating them and yet the script failed with MySQL 5.7.x.

The tricks that finally saved the day was found in this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9293042/how-to-perform-a-mysqldump-without-a-password-prompt). It involves specifying the credentials in a file named `.my.cnf` under your (or root's) home folder and making the file readable to only yourself and your group (`chmod 0640`). 
```
    [mysql]
    user=mysqluser
    password=secret
```
This allows you to use the mysql client from the command-line without specifying credentials. I've always used this trick to facilitate quick login to MySQL. Little did I know that just by repeating the same in .my.cnf and renaming one of the block headers to mysqldump, you can achieve the same effect for mysqldump as well.

The `.my.cnf` now looks like:
```

    [mysql]
    user=mysqluser
    password=secret

    [mysqldump]
    user=mysqluser
    password=secret
```
![Warning](http://www.freeiconspng.com/uploads/warning-icon-5.png)However, this takes care of only one part of the problem. The script still halts with the warning, as it is hard-coded to pass the credentials to mysqldump. That's where this fork comes in. All instances of credential arguments have been removed from the script.

### Installation

 1. Check-out / clone git repository.
 2. Run **install.sh**. This will replace any existing versions of `automysqlbackup` script in your `/usr/local/bin`.
 3. Do your configuration in `/etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf`.
 4. Run the script and/or add it to a cron job.
 
 To install it manually (the hard way).
 1. Create the /etc/automysqlbackup directory.
 2. Copy in the automysqlbackup.conf file.
 3. Copy the automysqlbackup file to /usr/local/bin and make executable.
 4. cp /etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf /etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf
 5. Edit the /etc/automysqlbackup/automysqlbackup.conf file to customise your settings.
 6. See usage section.
